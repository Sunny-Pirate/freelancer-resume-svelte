# Freelancing Resume Application
This project is a frontend application developed in Svelte to display an online resume. The application interfaces with a backend CMS developed in Strapi to fetch all the required information.

## Overview
The application is divided into three main sections, as described below:

- Homepage: This section showcases a brief introduction and personal details. Data is fetched from the "Personal Information" component 
in the Strapi CMS.
- Experiences: A detailed listing of work experiences. Each entry displays the company, role, start and end dates, and a brief 
  description. Experiences can be filtered based on the "Working Industry". Data is fetched from the Work Experience and Working Industry collection types in the Strapi CMS.
- Contact: A section dedicated to contact details, including phone, email, and social profiles. Data is fetched from the "Contact" 
  component in the Strapi CMS.
